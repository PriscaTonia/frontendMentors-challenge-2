## Overview
In general, I had fun creating this project, and this was because I used mobile first approach for this project.
### The challenge

One of the challenges I encountered was understanding the media queries because I had to reverse it because I was using Mobile-first approach, lol, I was getting a bit confused for the measurements, so yeah...

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

So, I started with getting my required font-family from google fonts, and setting up my html page, after that I started with my HTML structure, I basically created a div, which contains three sections, each section for a card.
I styled my project using CSS Flexbox for the most part. It was really a life saver.
I also adopted the Mobile-First approach, and basically I didn't experience much difference than I usually do with a Desktop-First approach, maybe it is because of the size of the project.. I look forward to testing this theory out some more.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I would like to learn how to implent media queries better, and also use the mobile-first workflow more frequently, lets say for my next project.

### Useful resources
One of my useful resources, actually my only useful resource is google (laughs...), so when I encounter any problem, I basically go to google to search for similar problems and their solutions. I didn't encounter much problems though, so yeah.. that's it.
